## Title
 -  MOSFET based music reactive flasher circuit.

- main aspect 
 its a high voltage music flasher which can run on 12V battery with 12V LED Strips

 MOSFETs to control the LEDs.
 capacitors to rectify the signals from the power supply and convert it into DC signal.
 resistance to limit the current flowing through the circuit.
 BJT transistor to control the LEDs.
